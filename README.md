# MetaAshEnchy
This repsitory is to collect the code for analysing the R code and metabarcoding analysis about influence of wood ash on enchytraeids.

The analysis includes bioinformatical and statistical parts:
1. Bioinformatical analysis on Miseq sequencing reads
2. Liner mixed-effects model to test if the wood ash influenced the number of enchytraeids
3. Liner mixed-effects model to test if the wood ahs influenced the relative read abundance.
