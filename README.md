# MetaAshEnchy
Scripts used to analyse metabarcoding sequences and population abundances of enchytraeids influenced by wood ash.
The analyses include bioinformatical and statistical parts:
1.	Bioinformatical analysis of MiSeq sequencing reads.
2.	Linear mixed-effects model to test if the wood ash treatment influenced the number of enchytraeids.
3.	Linear mixed-effects model to test if the wood ash treatment influenced the relative read abundance.
